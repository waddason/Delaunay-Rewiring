# ML with graphs - project

## Defense

The instructions are the following:
- You must **present the paper in 10 minutes + 5 minutes for questions**. I’ll need to be strict on the time constraint.
- The goal is not to present everything that is in the paper. You should **focus on presenting the key technical novelty introduced in the paper and explain how it advances the state of the art**. You can present the key experimental results but you should not try to cover all the experiments presented in the paper. You will be evaluated mostly on your **capacity to identify the most relevant information to summarize the paper**.
- Additionally, please try to **reproduce at least one of the experiments and compare your results** with what’s reported in the paper. If you’re unable to reproduce the results, you should explain why you were not able to run at least one of the experiments (Out-Of-Memory? High computational complexity? etc). 
- We recommend preparing a few slides, please do so in PDF format. The slides should be **submitted by March 24** to a link we’ll provide later. This is a strict deadline no matter if you’re presenting on March 25th or April 1st.

## Report
**The report is due on April 8th**. It's limited to 4 pages of content (excluding references) using the ICML template (https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/icml2025-template/dhxrkcgkvnkt).

This report is divided into two distinct sections. The first section is dedicated to **summarizing the paper**. Here, your focus should be on outlining the main contributions, highlighting key related works, providing an overview of the methodology, and delving into the key experiments conducted. For this part, you may find it beneficial to access the LaTeX source of the paper on arXiv (as "Other formats"). When incorporating tables and figures from the paper, prioritize the most pertinent ones, trimming any unnecessary details.

In the second section, your task is to **select another research paper** that bears significant relevance to your first paper. This could be a paper featuring a *competing* method, one that laid the *groundwork* for your paper, or even a subsequent *extension* of your paper. You must
    1. explain your choice,
    2. quickly summarize this second paper,
    3. discuss the relation with your first paper.

Academic dishonesty and intellectual laziness, such as relying on LLMs to completely generate your report or the speech of your presentation, will result in penalties. Please note that using LLMs to do light editing of your report is not forbidden.
