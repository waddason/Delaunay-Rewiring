## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations

   - Quality of Delaunay graph depends on quality of reduced features
   - Potential information loss during dimension reduction

2. **Computational Considerations**:
   - Delaunay triangulation complexity increases with node count
   - Current implementation loads full graph into memory
   - UMAP and curvature calculations add computational overhead

3. **Parameter Sensitivity**:
   - Impact of UMAP parameters not fully explored
   - Potential dependence on feature normalization
   - Effect of different train/val/test splits not extensively studied

### Future Work
1. **Algorithmic Improvements**:
   - Investigate higher-dimensional Delaunay triangulation
   - Explore sparse approximations for larger graphs
   - Develop incremental/streaming versions for large-scale graphs
   - Optimize UMAP parameter selection

2. **Analysis Extensions**:

   - Sensitivity to hyperparameters
   - Comparison of different triangulation algorithms

## Conclusion
The Delaunay rewiring approach demonstrates significant and consistent improvements on the Wisconsin dataset. The improvements are not only substantial in magnitude (14.4-14.6%) but also statistically significant (p < 0.0001), with both GCN and GAT models benefiting from the rewiring. The enhanced graph properties (improved homophily by 94% and reduced negative curvature) provide structural evidence for why the approach works well. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple runs demonstrate the robustness and reliability of these improvements. While there are some limitations and areas for future investigation, the current results strongly support the effectiveness of this approach for improving graph neural network performance.
